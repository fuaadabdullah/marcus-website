## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Key Features Implemented

### Homepage Components

- **Hero Section**: Logo placeholder, tagline, CTA button
- **Why Choose Us**: Three feature cards (Mobile Service, 15+ Years, Quality Work)
- **Services**: Grid of 12 automotive services with pricing
- **Gallery**: Before/after image placeholders and video section
- **Testimonials**: Customer reviews with ratings

## Dev tips: Analytics, images, and E2E

1. Add your analytics IDs (Vercel environment variables or `.env.local`):

```env
# Google Analytics Measurement ID (G-XXXX)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
# Facebook Pixel ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID=123456789012345
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

- **Vercel SpeedInsights**: Included in the root layout to improve performance observability in deployments.

2. Optimize images (requires `sharp`):

```
npm i -D sharp
npm run optimize:images
```

3. Run E2E tests with Playwright:

```
npx playwright install
npm run test:e2e
```

If you don't want to install `sharp` or Playwright, both the optimizer and tests will gracefully no-op or skip if dependencies are missing.

## CI / GitHub Actions (Playwright + Lighthouse + Vercel Deployments)

This repo includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that runs the build, Playwright E2E tests, Lighthouse report, and automatic Vercel deployments on push/PR to `main`:

- **Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/ci-marcus.yml` at the monorepo root
- **Jobs**: `build`, `test`, `preview` (PRs), `deploy` (main branch)

### Required GitHub Secrets

Before the workflow runs successfully, set the following repository `Secrets` in GitHub (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

**Required for all deployments:**

- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` — Vercel organization ID (get from Vercel dashboard → Settings → General)
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` — Vercel project ID (get from Vercel project dashboard)

**Required for production deployments:**

**Optional analytics:**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID` — Facebook Pixel ID

**Optional notifications:**

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — Slack webhook URL for deployment notifications

### Workflow Behavior

- Posts preview URL as PR comment
- Optionally posts to Slack

**On Push to Main:**

- Runs build, tests, and Lighthouse
